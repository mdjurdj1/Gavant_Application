  <p>Hey to all the great people at Gavant! I'd like to tell you a bit about how I got to where I'm at now. I taught myself the basics of coding several years back, hacking old computer games to artifically increase their difficulty (Baldur's Gate and Duke Nukem were some of my favorites!).
     Over the past few years, I was a hobbyist web designer, creating simple domains with wordpress and drupal for friends & family. Wanting to improve my skills and get to a point where I could create real applications,
     I spent many nights learning C# and JavaScript in Visual Studio. I took several college-level courses on Edx and Khan Academy in my free time to brush up on basic computer science concepts.
   </p>
  <p>See, I originally wanted to become a lawyer, so I studied politics and communication in college. While preparing for my LSAT, I found myself spending way too much time creating JavaScript functions to solve the formulaic logic puzzles I was coming across.
    Of course, being the novice programmer I was, my algorithms weren't all that consistent for anything but the easiest of questions. Still - I fell in love with functional programming, and the process of trying to solve puzzles with code.
    After a year of study, I took the LSAT and recieved a terrific score - good enough to put me in direct contact with Tier 1 recruiters. Despite having great opportunities, I chose to pursue my passion in programming instead.
  </p>
  <p>
    I completed a curriculum with one of the best coding schools in the country, the Flatiron School, which greatly bolstered my existing skillset as a Full-Stack Developer. I don't pretend to be the most experienced programmer around - I know that there's a ton out there for me to learn.
    What I <em>am</em> is highly motivated, bright-minded, and spirited. I don't believe there's a single language or framework out there that I'm incapable of learning, and I'm <em>constantly</em> pushing myself to learn new ones.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a focused, diligent worker with a sincere, time-tested love for programming. All I ask is for an opportunity to prove my value and work alongside your awesome team!
    I created this little webpage using Ember.js, because I know that's what your team is most comfortable with. I want you guys to know that I'll push myself to master any and every framework or library as needed. That's the kind of work ethic, focus, and commitment to improvement that I can bring
    your company.
